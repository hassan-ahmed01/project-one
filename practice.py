#FIRST AND SECOND PRACTICE 
#here we are going to add one of my fav. fruit
my_favorite_fruits = ["mango", "watermelon", "pineapple", "kiwi"]
my_favorite_fruits.append("orange")

#THIRD AND FORTH PRACTICE
#creating two lists of numbers
x = [2,4,6,8,10]
y = [3,5,7,9,11]
#now concatenated both lists
final_list = x + y 
print("concatenated_list:", final_list)

#now we are using our final_list to multiple with 2
multiplied_by_2 = [num * 2 for num in final_list]
print("concatenated_multiplied_list:", multiplied_by_2)


#FIFTH AND SIXTH PRACTICE 
#in this one we will cover both we are making weekdays using tuple and extract the third day of the week.... which is monday
weekdayz = ("saturday", "sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday")
third_day = weekdayz[2]
print("3rd_day_of_the_week_is:", third_day)
